# 4x4-Button-Arduino-Shortcut
4x4 PushButton to Arduino to Keyboard Shortcut (for Macro software to receive &amp; perform automation on computer)

Arduino code (.ino) just listens for button presses, determines which button was pressed, then sends a keyboard shortcut to the USB-connected computer.

.macros file contains macros for the "Keyboard Maestro" app on Mac comptuers. These macros do the heavy lifting for actually automating the interaction with the PGS app. Probably won't work out of the box, but should get you off to a good start, if you have Keyboard Maestro.
